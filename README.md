1. What is TypeScript, and how is it different from JavaScript?

TypeScript is an object-oriented language It is a superset of JavaScript and can be used both a language and a set of tools. However, there are several key differences between the two languages 
TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing you to explicitly declare types for variables, function parameters, and return values
TypeScript code is safer but a little trickier to write, resulting in more errors earlier in development
